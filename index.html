            Amitabh Bachchan, born on 11 October 1942, is an Indian film actor, film producer, television host, occasional playback singer, and former politician. He first gained popularity in the early 1970s for films such as Zanjeer, Deewaar, and Sholay, and was dubbed India's "angry young man" for his on-screen roles in Bollywood.

            Referred to as the "Shahenshah of Bollywood," "Star of the Millennium," or "Big B," he has since appeared in over 200 Indian films in a career spanning more than five decades. Bachchan is regarded as one of the greatest and most influential actors in the history of Indian cinema. So total was his dominance on the movie scene in the 1970s and 1980s that the French director Fran√ßois Truffaut called him a "one-man industry."
